# Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio
This is a collection of my projects and work in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Software Development. Here, you'll find AI-powered mobile apps, deep learning projects like lung cancer detection and staging, a virtual assistant, and web applications I've built. Each project reflects my passion for creating impactful, intelligent solutions using modern technologies like Python, Java, React Native, TensorFlow, and more. I'm always exploring innovative ways to apply AI for real-world impact.
